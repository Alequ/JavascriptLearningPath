  ###  5. Functions
      A function is a subprogram that can be called by code external or internal in case of recursion to the function.Like the program itself a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body.Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.
      In Javascript, functions are first-class objects, becouse they can have properties and methods just like any other object.

      function name(param1,param2...){
      statements
      }
      name = the function name
      param = The name of an argument passed to the function, can have up o 255 arguments
      statements = the statements comprising the body of function.

      function presentation(name,age){
      console.log("Your name is ${name} and you're ${age} years old")
      }
      presentation("Alex", 26) // Your name is Alex and you're 26 years old
      presentation("Cristina",25) // your name is Cristina and you're 25 years old.
